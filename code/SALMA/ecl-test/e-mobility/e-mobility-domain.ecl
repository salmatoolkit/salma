% communication flow:
% 1. PLCSSAM reads all current vehicleReservationRequests
% 2. PLCSSAM selects best PLCS for each vehicle
% 3. PLCSSAM writes to PLCS::reservations
% 4. PLCSSAM sets Vehice::reservation

 
% The list of reservation requests that a vehicle intends to send to the PLCSSAM. Each request
% includes a list of alternatives for possible PLCSs. The PLCSSAM is supposed to select
% the optimal PLCS out of this list.
