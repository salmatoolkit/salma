\begin{easylist}[itemize]
& The world is represented as a 2D space that is segmented into quadratic cells.
& Each cell has a state that can consist of several state fluents like fire, smoke, avg_temperature,
etc.
& Firefighters have integer 2D coordinates that specify their position within the bounds of a cell.
& Firefighters move along integer coordinates, thus entering and exiting cells as they move.
& Firefighters start from the center of a cell and move to the center of the destination cell. This can be seen as "forgetting" the exact position.
